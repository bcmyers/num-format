//! A helper crate for [num-format] that only exists because num-format on Windows requires
//! [bindgen] as a build dependency, which, if not broken out into a separate crate, would
//! prevent num-format from being built in a `no_std` environment (build dependendies cannot
//! currently be made contingent on the compilation target).
//!
//! Said differently, don't use this crate directly. It's just a work-around for
//! [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1439](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1439).
