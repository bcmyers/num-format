0.4.2 (2022-10-09)
==================

* Bump 3rd party dependencies
* Update [cldr-numbers-full](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-numbers-full) 
  git submodule to commit [b52a87048985d3052f12d30d05cfe5423ad92709](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-numbers-full/commit/b52a87048985d3052f12d30d05cfe5423ad92709)
* `Locale::from_str` now supports underscore-delimited locales, e.g. "de_DE",
  in addition to previously supported dash-delimiated locales, e.g "de-DE"

0.4.0 (2019-02-19)
==================
**Breaking changes:**

* Because `SystemLocale` requires a lot of dependencies (especially for Windows users),
  it's now only available behind a feature flag (`with-system-locale`). The upside is,
  of course, that those using num-format without this feature will only need to download and
  compile a small handful of dependencies.

0.3.0 (2019-02-18)
==================
**Breaking changes:**

* `Environment` was renamed to `SystemLocale`.
* `Error` and `ErrorKind` were refactored.
* Compiling for Windows depends on bindgen and so requires Clang 3.9 or above.

**Bug fixes:**

* num-format now works on Windows!

**Enhancements:**

* Major overhaul of the code that interacts with operating systems (linux, macOS, freebsd, Windows, etc.)
* Methods `available_names`, `from_name`, and `name` were added to both `Locale` and `SystemLocale`.
* Several error messages now provide more detail about what exactly went wrong.

0.2.1 (2019-02-06)
==================
**Bug fixes:**

* `WriteFormatted` was being unconditionally implemented on `std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`,
which is a unix-only type; so we moved this implementation behind a `#[cfg(unix)]` flag.

0.2.0 (2019-02-06)
==================
**Breaking changes:**

* Flatten module structure
    * We decided to flatten the module structure of num-format to both improve code readabiity
    and to simplify the importing of types by users. Unfortunately this is a breaking change.
    * The `num_format::format` and `num_format::errors` modules have been removed and all
    of their containing types have been moved to the crate root.
    * So whereas one used to do this:

    ```rust
    use num_format::errors::{Error, ErrorKind};
    use num_format::format::{CustomFormat, Environment, Format, Locale};
    use num_format::format::utils::{InfinityStr, MinusSignStr, NanStr};
    ```

    * one now does this:

    ```rust
    use num_format::{CustomFormat, Environment, Error, ErrorKind, Format, Locale};
    use num_format::utils::{InfinityStr, MinusSignStr, NanStr};
    ```

    * Thank you [BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi) for the [suggestion](https://github.com/bcmyers/num-format/issues/3#issuecomment-460615939)

* Refactor `Error` and `ErrorKind`
    * Since the future of the [failure crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure)
    is up in the air, we decided to remove it as a dependency, refactoring
    `num_format::Error` and `num_format::ErrorKind` to work with just plain old `std::error::Error`
    * Thank you [BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi) for the [suggestion](https://github.com/bcmyers/num-format/issues/3#issuecomment-460615939)

**New features:**

* impl `From<Environment>` and `From<Locale>` for `CustomFormat`
    * Now you can easiliy turn an `Environment` or a `Locale` into a `CustomFormat`; so it's easy
    to start with an already complete "base" format and then just tweak it slightly to the custom
    format you want.

    ```rust
    use num_format::{CustomFormat, Error, Locale, ToFormattedString};

    fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
        let format = CustomFormat::from(Locale::en_IN)
            .into_builder()
            .separator(Some(' '))
            .build()?;
        let s = 1_000_000.to_formatted_string(&format);
        assert_eq!(&s, "10 00 000");
        Ok(())
    }
    ```
